According to the Irvings, a creature named Gef introduced itself and told them it was a mongoose born in <a href="/wiki/New_Delhi" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, India, in 1852. According to Voirrey, Gef was the size of a small rat with yellowish fur and a large bushy tail.</p><p>The Irvings say that Gef communicated to them that he was "an extra extra clever mongoose", an "Earthbound spirit" and "a ghost in the form of a mongoose" and once said, "I am a freak. I have hands and I have feet, and if you saw me you'd faint, you'd be petrified, mummified, turned into stone or a pillar of salt!"<sup id="cite_ref-josiffe1_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-josiffe1-1">[1]</a></sup> The Irvings made various claims about Gef: he supposedly guarded their house and informed them of the approach of guests or any unfamiliar dog. They said that if someone had forgotten to put out the fire at night, Gef would go down and stop the stove. The Irvings claimed Gef would also wake people up when they overslept. And whenever <a href="/wiki/Mice" title="Mice" class="mw-redirect">mice</a> got into the house, Gef supposedly assumed the role of the cat, although he preferred to scare them rather than kill them. The Irvings say they gave Gef biscuits, chocolates and bananas, and food was left for him in a saucer suspended from the ceiling which he took when he thought no one was watching. The Irvings claimed the mongoose regularly accompanied them on trips to the market, but always stayed on the other side of the hedges, chatting incessantly.</p><p>The story of Gef became popular in the <a href="/wiki/Tabloid_journalism" title="Tabloid journalism">tabloid</a> press, and many journalists flocked to the Isle to try to catch a glimpse of the creature.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Several other people, both locals and visitors, claimed to have heard Gef's voice, and two claimed to have seen it,<sup id="cite_ref-josiffe1_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-josiffe1-1">[1]</a></sup> however physical evidence was lacking. Footprints, stains on the wall, and hair samples claimed to be evidence of Gef were identified as belonging to the Irvings' sheepdog, as were several photos which were claimed by the Irvings to depict Gef.<sup id="cite_ref-willett2_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-willett2-3">[3]</a></sup></p><p>Margaret and Voirrey Irving left the home in 1945 after the death of James Irving. They reportedly had to sell the farm at a loss because it had the reputation of being haunted. In 1946, Leslie Graham, the actor who had bought their farm, claimed in the press that he had shot and killed Gef. The body displayed by Graham was, however, black and white and much larger than the famous mongoose and Voirrey Irving was certain that it was not Gef. She died in 2005. In an interview published late in life, she maintained that Gef was not her creation.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychic_investigators">Psychic investigators</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Gef&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Psychic investigators">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2><p>In July 1935 the editor of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Listener_(magazine)" title="The Listener (magazine)">The Listener</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Richard_S._Lambert" title="Richard S.
